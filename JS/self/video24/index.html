    <title>Callback in JS</title>
</head>
<body>
    javascript is a single threaded language.
    it means it only process one task at a time, if it a task is taking a large time to 
    process, it get bloced, user interface freezes, adn the application becomes unresponsive.
    to solve this javascript uses an JavaScript uses an asynchronous, model for these log-running tasks. 
    this is like our chef putting the chickeen in the oven (a long task ) and then moving on to other tasks like chopping vegeatables while it cooks.
    They don't wait for the chicken; they just know it will be ready later.
