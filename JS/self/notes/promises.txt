what are promises?

Promise means future representation of a task
or value which can be fulfulled or rejected
but currently it is pending

why do we use promises in javascript

because it help us to get out of callback hell
how?

let's understand by example, 

let's say I have some users data
first I have to get its' users, then posts and then comments

so I first I'll create a function to 
different functions  to get the specific value
and then I'll those function inside a function, so that they will be called
if the first function is completed


so it'll make a pyramid of hell
but promises help us to solve it because
we can return a promise, and .then will be execute only
after the promise is resolved or .catch will be executed

let's see it with a example

// let fetchUser = () =>{
    return new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
        resolve("HELLO WORLD")
    }).then((text)=.{
        console.log(text)
    })
}

// if we return a function in then, it becomes a new promise and next .then wait for it to complete

javascript is a single threaded language, it means every function is executed one by one, so 
to solve the problem to not wait till a function is completed, we use asynchronous javascript
