when we use getElementsByTagName or getElementsByClassName

it presents the live html collection
whereas when use we querySelector, it presents the static node list

so what is the difference between this live and static, like if I get all elements in html collection, and store it in a variable, even if I change the some properties of the elements, my variable properties will change automatically

whereas in querySelector node list, it takes a snapshop of that moment when the variable is declared, so it's static, even if I change the element later, variable will not be updated

we can't use foreach of html collection, where we can use it on the node list


// although both in proper sense are not arrays, but they are iterables, so we can use for loop on them
