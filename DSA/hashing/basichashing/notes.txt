hashing means prestoring a data into an object or array form and then fetch it,
what is we have to find how many times a number appear in an array, 
we can do it by brute force method, where we'll go through each number, and loop it over for it, and find it's count
though it's not the very best solution for this

for this we use technique called hashing, in this we create a array for length which is 1 increased by the highest number present in the array of the data, or highest number we have to find the data for

and for every index, we store how much times a number appear for it, 
so, we can easily now fetch for a specific index, how much time a number is appeared



// Let's learn how Map hashing works in Javascript

when we create a key value pair in js, it convert the key into a hash number, and store the data there,
and when we fetch the data again, it uses the same function to get the hash number from the key and loop instantly 
its' Time Complexity is O(1), in average and best cases, someitmes if there if collision, like storing two different value in same key, 
it's time complexity becomes O(N)
