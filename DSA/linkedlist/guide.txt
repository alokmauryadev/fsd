// a linked list is a linear data structure where it's element are called nodes, each nodes contain two data (value(the actual paylond) and next(reference to memory address of next node))

// we can get a node 4, until we get node 3, so each in linked list, we link the each node

// In JS, we do not have memory references, so we use object references so what is node, node is a struct (or an object) allocated to heap memory
// it exist independent of other nodes

// IT'S ACCESS IS O(n), not O(1

class Node{
    constructor(value){
        this.value = value
        this.next = null;
    }
}

// pitfall: if we lose the reference to a node(i.e. nothing points to it), the garbage Collector will delete it

// The Head and Tail

// Head: A pointer variable maintained by Linked list instance that refernce to first node object

// Tail: A pointer variable which reference to last node object.

// termination: the list ends when a node's next property is strict null.

// insertion or prepend

let head = new Node(5)
let newNode = new Node(10)
newNode.next = head;
head = newNode

console.log(newNode)



because v8 engine implement fast contigious memory block like C++, and Hash Map(sparse arrays)
// Javascript arrays are not linked list, in js array, prepend operation is O(n) and where as append is O(1),
and it's lookup is also o(1). but in linked list, prepend is O(1) as we have reference to the head
