Sunlight splintered through the dusty windows of the antique shop.
It illuminated a single, tarnished brass compass.
Its needle spun erratically, never settling on a single direction.
The shop's owner, Elias, watched as a young girl entered.
Her hair was the girl color of rust.
Her eyes immediately locked onto the peculiar object.
She didn't haggle, didn't even ask the price.
She simply laid down a crumpled twenty-dollar bill.
Elias, sensing a story he wouldn't be part of, simply nodded.
Outside, the girl, named Lyra, clutched the compass tightly.
She had been searching for something, a purpose she couldn't name.
The compass felt warm in her palm, a living thing.
Its needle, which had been dancing wildly, shivered and pointed toward the old library.
Lyra didn't hesitate.
She walked past the busy streets and towering skyscrapers.
Inside the library, the compass led her to a forgotten section.
It tugged her toward a specific book with no title.
As she opened it, the pages were blank.
But the compass began to glow, casting a shimmering map across the empty paper.
Lyra realized the compass didn't point to a place, but to a path.
